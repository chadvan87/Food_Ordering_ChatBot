# How to run 
## Step 1:
Download and install python from this website<br>
https://www.python.org/downloads/<br>
I am using Python 3.9.7. Make sure to check the add python to path option when you install python.
## Step 2: Clone the project:
Click on the "Code" button and select "Download Zip"
## Step 3: Install libraries
You can use command prompt on windows or terminal on Mac or any IDE(ex: Visual Studio Code)
Make sure you are in the path of the project and type :
pip install -r requirements.txt
It will install all the files you need.
## Step 4: Run the project
Type in your terminal: python manage.py runserver 
It will load for a while and said
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Go to that link and it will display a page like this<br>

Now you change the link to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/bot/
And it will get into my chat bot:
